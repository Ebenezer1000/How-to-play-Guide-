- 5D Board Games Bull Bull

1.  Big : When you choose big, the sum of the five numbers in the winning draw numbers should be between 23-45 (23 and 45 inclusive), this is a win .

Small : When you choose small, the sum of the five numbers in the winning draw numbers should be between 0-22 (0 and 22 inclusive), this is a win.

Odd : When you choose odd, the sum of the five numbers in the winning draw numbers should be an odd number, this is a win.

Even : When you choose even, the sum of the five numbers in the winning draw numbers should be an even number, this is a win.

Eg. If the winning numbers are 2, 3, 9, 4, 5

The sum of the 5 winning numbers is: 2+3+9+4+5=23

The sum of the winning five numbers is equal to 23, which is between 23-45 and is considered big and odd.

If you choose big or odd, you win.

2.    Bull N : If the sum of any three of the five numbers in the winning number ends with 0 or multiples of 10 and the sum of the remaining two numbers ends with N, then it is Bull N (e.g. 12347:  7+1+2=10 “ends with 0”, the remaining two numbers 3 and 4 sum: 3+4=7. This makes the draw number a Bull 7 , 00206: 0+0+0=0 “ends with 0”, the remaining two numbers 2 and 6 sum: 2+6=8. This makes the draw number a Bull 8, 01828: 0+2+8=10 “ends with 0” the remaining two numbers 1 and 8 sum: 1+8=9. This makes the draw number a Bull 9 )

Bull Bull: If the remaining two numbers also sum up and end with 0, N=0, it is Bull Bull. (e.g. 66882: 6+8+6= 20 “ends with 0”, the remaining two numbers 8 and 2 sum: 8+2=10 and 23500: 2+3+5=10 “ends with 0”, the remaining two numbers 0 and 0 sum: 0+0=0  are both Bull Bull )

No Bull : If the sum of any three of the five digits in the winning number does not equal 0, it is a No Bull.  (eg. 01234: The sum of any three numbers out of the five winning numbers does not equal 0 or multiples of 10 )

Note: When five numbers are the same, only 00000 is considered as Bull Bull, any other such as 11111, 66666, etc. are all No Bull.


3.  Maximum value : Winning Condition - If the betting position you select corresponds to the position of the biggest number in the drawn sequence, you win. Eg.  If you bet on Ball 4 being the maximum value and the drawn numbers are 4, 7, 1, 8, 2: The number 8 is in the Ball 4 position and is the highest number in the sequence. Therefore, you win if you bet on Ball 4 having the maximum value. (If there are multiple identical maximum values, only one of them will do)

4. Minimum value : Winning Condition - If the betting position you select corresponds to the position of the smallest number in the drawn sequence, you win. Eg. If you bet on the Ball 3 being the minimum value, and the drawn numbers are 4, 9, 1, 8, 2: The number 1 is in the Ball 3 position and is the smallest number in the sequence. Therefore, you win if you bet on Ball 3 having the minimum value.(if there are multiple identical minimum values, only one of them will do)


5. Dragon: If the numerical value of Ball 4 is greater (>) than the numerical value of ball 5, you win if you select Dragon. Eg. If the drawn winning numbers are 4, 9, 1, 8, 2. If you compare the numerical value of Ball 4 (8) with the numerical value of Ball 5 (02). Since 08 > 02, selecting Dragon would result in a win.

    Tiger: If the numerical value of Ball 4 is lesser (<) than the numerical value of ball 5, you win if you select Tiger.  Eg. If the drawn winning numbers are 6, 8, 7, 1, 9. Compare the numerical value of Ball 4 (1) with the numerical value of Ball 5 (9). Since 01 < 09, selecting Tiger would result in a win."

Tie : If the numerical value of Ball 4 is equal (=) to the numerical value of ball 5, you win if you select Tie. Eg.  If the drawn winning numbers are 6, 7, 8, 0, 0. Compare the numerical value of Ball 4 (0) with the numerical value of Ball 5 (0). Since 0 = 0 Since, selecting Tie  would result in a win."
